Terror gripped them. They tried to flee, but an invisible force seemed to hold them in place. The moan grew louder, closer, until it became a deafening shriek that seemed to tear through their minds.
Nimo, in a moment of clarity, pointed his camera at the orb. As he snapped a picture, the orb exploded in a shower of green sparks, sending a wave of energy crashing over them.
They collapsed, unconscious. When they awoke, they were back outside the mansion, the rising sun painting the sky in warm hues. The mansion looked peaceful, almost idyllic. But they knew what they had seen, felt, and heard. The experience had changed them.
Later, at the university library, Iqra found a newspaper clipping from the 1920s detailing the disappearance of Silas Blackwood. The article mentioned a series of unexplained occurrences around the mansion, and a local historian had suggested that Blackwood had succeeded in opening a gateway to another dimension – a gateway they had inadvertently reopened.
Nimo's camera held a single, blurry photograph of the glowing orb. Examining it closely, they noticed something unusual—a faint, humanoid shape seemed to be embedded within the green light, a distorted reflection of their own faces, their eyes hollowed and devoid of life, faces of something far beyond human comprehension. The horror had been more than just a ghostly experience; it was a glimpse into the unseen, a frightening vision that would stay with them forever. The mansion stood silent, its secrets guarded, waiting for the next curious souls to dare to explore its depths.
