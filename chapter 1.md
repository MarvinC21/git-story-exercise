Chapter 1

The old Victorian mansion stood on a hill overlooking the university. Its darkened windows stared out like empty eyes, a silent sentinel of forgotten secrets. Marvin, Nimo, Jersey, and Iqra, four university students fascinated by the local legends, decided to explore it. They’d heard whispers of strange happenings, ghostly figures, and chilling whispers echoing through the halls.
Marvin, the pragmatic leader, carried a flashlight. Nimo, the skeptic, held a camera, ready to debunk any paranormal claims. Jersey, ever the thrill-seeker, bounced with nervous energy. Iqra, the quiet observer, clutched a worn, leather-bound book, a local history detailing the mansion’s past.
The heavy oak door creaked open, revealing a shadowy hallway. Dust motes danced in the beam of Marvin’s flashlight, illuminating peeling wallpaper and cobweb-draped furniture. A chilling draft snaked through the house, causing Jersey to shiver.
“This place gives me the creeps,” Jersey whispered, her voice barely audible above the unsettling silence.
